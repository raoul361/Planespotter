# Planespotter

This little app shows me planes approaching my local airport. Based on a geo fencing api lookup fed into slack.

You'll need to define LocalAirport code and the lat/lon of the area to seach for. Keep the range tight, 
but experiment for what works for you. Mine was set up for the approach path as seen from my back window.

Please play nice with adsbexchange. They are doing it for free!

## Dependencies

You'll need to get your own slack webhook - https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks
